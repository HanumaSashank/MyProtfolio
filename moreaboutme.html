        <h2>More About Me</h2>
        <p>I am in my final semester of a Master's in Computer Science at UMBC, passionate about AI/ML, Data Engineering, and Application Development. 
            After earning my Bachelor’s in Computer Science from SASTRA University, India (2021), I worked as a Full Stack Engineering Analyst at Accenture, 
            where I built data pipelines using Azure Data Factory, developed backend APIs with Python FastAPI, and led the creation of a Supply Chain Network Digital Twin using Palantir Software. 
            This experience strengthened my expertise in data engineering, web applications, and dashboard development, exposing me to large-scale real-world projects. 
            My growing curiosity for advanced AI and scalable data systems led me to pursue my master’s, where I have deepened my technical expertise and worked on innovative, research-driven projects. 
            This journey has fueled my drive to develop intelligent, data-driven solutions that create real-world impact.
