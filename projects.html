            <h3>Distributed File System</h3>
            <p>Designed and developed a fault-tolerant Distributed File System (DFS) with a modular client-server architecture to ensure reliable file storage, retrieval, and high availability. 
                The system incorporates automatic failover and replication mechanisms, allowing seamless data access even in the event of server failures. 
                To enhance resilience, I implemented dynamic server selection and load balancing, optimizing resource utilization and system stability. 
                Additionally, the DFS includes metadata management and a FIFO-based locking mechanism for efficient concurrency control, preventing data conflicts during simultaneous access. 
                Rigorous testing with 50 concurrent clients using Docker demonstrated significant improvements in scalability and reduced response times, making the system well-suited for handling large-scale distributed storage operations.</p>

            <h3>Single Image Super Resolution using Two-Stage Neural Network Architecture</h3>
            <p>Developed a two-stage neural network for Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR), integrating SRCNN and SRGAN models to enhance image quality beyond individual model performance. 
                By applying nine fusion techniques, we optimized fine details, contrast, and sharpness, with the Intensity Hue Saturation (IHS) fusion achieving the best results. 
                The model improved Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) to 33.06, Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to 0.90, and reduced Mean Squared Error (MSE) to 96.39, demonstrating superior resolution enhancement. 
                This approach leverages the complementary strengths of CNN-based and GAN-based architectures, pushing the boundaries of deep learning-driven image super-resolution.</p>

            <h3>SentimentScope</h3>
            <p>Developed SentimentScope, an AI-driven sentiment analysis web platform designed to provide real-time sentiment insights across diverse text sources. 
                The platform utilizes three fine-tuned NLP models: RoBERTa for tweets, DistilBERT for emotion detection, and DistilBERT for Amazon product reviews, achieving 92%, 88%, and 87% accuracy, respectively. 
                By implementing a multi-model strategy, SentimentScope selects predictions with the highest confidence scores to enhance domain-specific sentiment analysis and minimize edge-case errors. 
                This tool is ideal for businesses, marketers, and researchers seeking precise sentiment trends, helping them make data-driven decisions based on customer feedback and public opinion.</p>

            <h3>Epic Tale: Adaptive Genre Gaming</h3>
            <p>Developed EpicTale, a text-based interactive game powered by OpenAIâ€™s GPT models, delivering dynamic, genre-specific storytelling across fantasy, sci-fi, and mystery. 
                The game adapts to player choices using one-shot prompting, ensuring a unique and immersive narrative experience. I built a React.js-based interface for seamless player interaction and a Node.js backend to handle API calls and game logic. 
                By leveraging prompt engineering, the AI-generated text aligns with the nuances of each genre, creating a highly engaging and adaptive gameplay experience.</p>

            <h3>Anomaly Detection via Robust Graphical Lasso</h3>
            <p>This project enhances Graphical Lasso for anomaly detection in high-dimensional data by integrating Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) and Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). 
                Our method efficiently isolates anomalies while preserving essential data structures.Tested on a simulated dataset, it achieved an F1-score of 0.57142, outperforming RPCA and Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD). 
                This scalable approach has applications in cybersecurity, fraud detection, and financial analytics, with future improvements focused on real-time processing and distributed computing..</p>
